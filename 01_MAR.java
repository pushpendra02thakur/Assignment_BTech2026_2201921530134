// When a subclass inherits from a superclass, it also inherits its methods; however, it can also override the superclass methods (as well as declare and implement new ones). Consider the following Sports class:
// Next, we create a Soccer class that inherits from the Sports class. We can override the getName method and return a different, subclass-specific string:
//   Note: When overriding a method, you should precede it with the @Override annotation. The parameter(s) and return type of an overridden method must be exactly the same as those of the method inherited from the supertype.
